# About me
I would like to improve my set of skills as an intern and grow from my position upwards in my career.
My recent experience is graphic design with PowerPoint design, converting to Pdf, creating mekko graphs and maps.

Life makes you tough, it makes you resilient and it makes you adaptable. I think I had these qualities before but they have certainly strengthened and grown.
I think i was more able to be brave and a little bolder to help others and also to get over my fears and to get over my own issues and conflexes andÂ insecurities.

My long term goal is to complete my studies in computer science
My short term goal is to buy my first home within 5 years

Adapting personal life circumstances made me accomplish all my goals and learnt to how to adapt in my working enviroment as well.
Life dont get better you get better
